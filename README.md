# Cool SASS stuff

A lunch and learn By AL Leonard for Sparkgeo.

## Install SASS

`brew install sass/sass/sass`

change directory to the sytles folder

`cd styles`

watch for changes with SASS

`sass --watch scss/source.scss:css/source.css`

run it on whatever server you want. I use `live-server` https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server
